# The-Mooseman-Crimson-Code

Our project for the hackathon was to learn how to properly use Unity and learn how to implement C# 
code to do specific functions that would help us create a game.

Our game idea was to create cookie clicker in Unity, by creating our own assets while also,
creating our own code for the game. 

We were unable to finish the project due to how much learning we needed to understand Unity, 
while also learning how to properly use C# for functions. However, we did get pretty far to where
we were almost able to get done with it. 

The main unity project and assets are in our Unity project folder where the main project is.
In the Mooseman folder, this is where are other assets / unused assets are and other attempts
at creating hte project.

Hopefully you enjoy what we tried to create for the project!

The mooseman.
